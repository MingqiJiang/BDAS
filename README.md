# Note:
BDAS_mjia487.ipynb is modeling for US's COVID-19 (by using Pyspark). Most of the code is using pyspark. But after looking up to the api reference of pyspark carefully, we cannot find anything related to AMIRA, so we use the python library statsmodels as instead. It can work on 722's PC.

mjia487_DataVisualization.ipynb is plot some figure for our dataset(detail in figure file). it can not run on 722's PC. Because the version of pyecharts can not run on Python 3.5. it need Python 3.6+.
